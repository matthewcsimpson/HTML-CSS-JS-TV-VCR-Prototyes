# HTML-CSS-JavaScript Television

This project was created as a prototype for a website concept I am building.  

The Television itself is built entirely in HTML and CSS, including the scan lines over the picture. 

Turning the TV on and changing the channel is powered by Vanilla JavaScript.  

You can see the TV up and running in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/matthewcsimpson/pen/KKLQwxd)
