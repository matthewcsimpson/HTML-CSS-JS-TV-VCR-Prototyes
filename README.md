# HTML-CSS-JS TV/VCR

This project was created to house prototypes for a website concept.

### TV & VCR

The Television itself is built in HTML and CSS, including the scan lines over the picture.

Turning the TV on and changing the channel is powered by Vanilla JavaScript.

You can see the TV up and running in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/matthewcsimpson/pen/jOjNYyM). Remember the TV has to be on channel 3!
