## HTML-CSS-JavaScript TV/VCR Project Prototypes 

This project was created to house prototypes for a website concept.   

### TV & VCR
The Television itself is built entirely in HTML and CSS, including the scan lines over the picture. 

Turning the TV on and changing the channel is powered by Vanilla JavaScript.  

You can see the TV up and running in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/matthewcsimpson/pen/jOjNYyM)

### VHS Tape 

A 3D model of a VHS tape modelled after a certan classic design from the 1990s.  Created using HTML and CSS, and then rotated using Vanilla Javascript.

[This tutorial](https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/box) was the starting point. 

You can see this up and running in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/matthewcsimpson/pen/QWXyOgv/19481e76064dd02473321534c95edbff)
